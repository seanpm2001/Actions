## GitHub actions

### By seanpm2001

[`Go! action`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Setup-Go2004-GitHubAction/) **Not to be confused with Google `Go`lang, which was created over 5 years after `Go!`** _(note the exclamation point)_

When I created this repository ([:octocat: `actions`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Actions/)) I thought I had more than 1 workflow repository.

## GitLab actions

None yet.

## General Git workflows

None yet.

### Workflow usage

#### Failing workflows

##### Why they are kept

They are kept for demonstration purposes.

#### All architectures

Workflows are implemented for all architectures and platforms that the project is designed for (or planned to be designed for) regardless of initial functionality.

#### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages workflows are included in most newer repositories, and also older ones of significance. They need work to get the initial site to work and function cleanly.

#### Notable workflows

- [:octocat: `GitHub_Stats_A`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Stats_A/) - There is 1 workflow on this repository, which has been running almost daily since 2022 June. It generates GitHub profile statistics for the @seanpm2001 account.
